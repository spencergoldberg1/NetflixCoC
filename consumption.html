                <p><span class="image left"><img src="https://encrypted-tbn2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcT6iYO8lZhcYbFFs1QQ5i_1RjESdE5wVWW-FkhsNdPMKhMajFKr" alt="" /></span>Netflix's consumption patterns reveal a dynamic and evolving landscape of media viewing habits. In 2022, the company generated $31.6 billion in revenue, a 6.7% increase from the previous year, indicating its dominant presence in the global streaming market. Despite a brief decline in subscriber count in early 2022, Netflix saw growth in the subsequent quarters. This resilience is underscored by its global reach, with subscribers in around 190 countries and a significant viewer base in North America, Europe, Africa, the Middle East, Latin America, and the Asia Pacific (Business of Apps).

                    Netflix's user base predominantly consists of younger adults, particularly Gen Z and Millennials, with a median age between 35-44 years old. However, older generations, such as Gen X and Baby Boomers, also form a substantial portion of its audience. Demographically, the platform is slightly more popular among female viewers than male, and in the U.S., it strongly correlates with the average US citizen's profile. The company's largest demographic group falls into the $35-50K income bracket, but more affluent consumers earning $75K or above also make up a significant chunk of its market (Start.io; Business of Apps).

The Asia Pacific region, in particular, has shown remarkable growth in subscriber numbers and revenue. As for content preferences, “The Office” is the most streamed show on Netflix, with over 57 billion minutes watched. The platform's users spend approximately 2 hours per day on Netflix, reflecting their deep engagement with the service. Interestingly, around 31% of users do not pay for the platform, indicating widespread account sharing. Furthermore, Netflix's recommendation system plays a crucial role in viewer engagement, with 1,300 "recommendation clusters" tailored to users' viewing preferences (Business of Apps; Gitnux).

Additionally, the platform's commitment to technology is evident in its offering of content in 4K quality, with 37% of all Netflix streams in North America being in 4K, reflecting a trend towards higher-quality, more immersive viewing experiences (Start.io; Gitnux).

                    In conclusion, Netflix's consumer behavior and usage patterns highlight the platform's significant influence on global media consumption. The company's ability to attract and retain subscribers across different age groups, income levels, and geographic regions underscores its widespread appeal and adaptability in an increasingly competitive market.
