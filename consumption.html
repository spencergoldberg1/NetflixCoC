                <h4>Consumption</h4>
                <p><span class="image left"><img src="https://encrypted-tbn2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcT6iYO8lZhcYbFFs1QQ5i_1RjESdE5wVWW-FkhsNdPMKhMajFKr" alt="" /></span>The consumption patterns of
                    Netflix users showcase a profound shift in the landscape of media viewing, characterized by a
                    significant increase in streaming hours and a diverse demographic reach. In 2022, Netflix amassed a
                    staggering 221.64 million paid subscribers, with streaming revenue reaching approximately $30
                    billion, indicating its dominant presence in the global streaming market (TrueList​​).

                <p><span class="image right"><img src="https://truelist.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/The-Average-Daily-Time-US-Adults-Spent-Watching-Netflix-in-the-Past-5-Years.jpg.webp" alt="" /></span>The average Netflix user spends
                    a substantial amount of time consuming content on the platform. In 2019, users spent about two hours
                    per day on average watching Netflix, a figure that surged to around 3.2 hours per day during the
                    quarantine period in 2020, equating to over 203 million hours of daily streaming in the U.S. alone
                    (TrueList​​). This dramatic increase in viewing time during the pandemic highlights the platform's
                    significance in the daily lives of its users.

                <p><span class="image left"><img src="https://truelist.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Distribution-of-US-Adults-That-Share-Their-Netflix-Account-Passwords-and-With-Whom.jpg.webp" alt="" /></span>Account sharing is another
                    notable aspect of Netflix's consumption patterns. Approximately 25.6% of American users share their
                    Netflix account with relatives, and 17.7% share it with friends. Despite concerns regarding account
                    sharing, a significant number of users, around 47.5%, do not share passwords (TrueList​​). This
                    behavior reflects the social aspect of streaming, where Netflix serves not just individual viewers
                    but also families and friend groups.

                <p><span class="image right"><img src="https://truelist.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Distribution-of-Netflix-Signups-and-Watch-Time-by-Device.jpg.webp" alt="" /></span>Device usage also plays a
                    crucial role in Netflix consumption. While mobile and laptops account for a significant portion of
                    sign-ups, most users eventually migrate to watching Netflix on TV. This shift towards larger screens
                    underscores the platform's role in providing a cinematic experience in the comfort of one's home
                    (TrueList​​).

                <p><span class="image left"><img src="https://truelist.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Age-Demographics-of-Netflix-Users-in-the-US.jpg.webp" alt="" /></span>Demographically, Netflix's core
                    subscriber base has evolved over time. Initially dominated by younger audiences, the platform now
                    sees a more balanced age distribution, with Generation X and Millennials forming the core
                    viewership. Interestingly, the median age of core subscribers lies between 35 and 44 years old,
                    reflecting the platform's wide appeal across different age groups (TrueList​​). Additionally, women
                    make up a slightly larger portion of the user base at 51%, and around 65% of Netflix consumers are
                    from outside the United States and Canada, showcasing its global reach (Demand Sage​​).

                    consumption patterns reveal a dynamic and evolving landscape. The platform has not only altered how
                    content is consumed but also who consumes it, expanding its reach across various demographics and
                    geographies. This evolution in viewing habits and the broadening of its user base underline
                    Netflix's role in shaping modern media consumption trends.
