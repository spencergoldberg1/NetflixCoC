                <h4>Identity</h4>
                <p><span class="image left"><img src="https://99firms.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/pub/attachments/netflix-user-count-by-region-61f03b111ff83.jpg" alt="" /></span>Netflix has become a cultural
                    phenomenon, profoundly shaping viewers' identities, lifestyles, and societal norms. By the end of
                    2016, Netflix's growth had reached a staggering 83 million subscribers globally, a clear indication
                    of its expansive influence (reviewsphere.org). This global reach has not only changed how people
                    consume entertainment but also how they perceive and interact with the world around them.


                </p>
                <p><span class="image right"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></span>The streaming giant’s content
                    catalog, featuring shows and documentaries, has had a significant impact on public discourse and
                    cultural trends. The release of "The Social Dilemma" on Netflix, for example, ignited a global
                    conversation about the impact of social media on mental health and privacy, leading to a notable
                    increase in people re-evaluating their social media use (thenextweb.com). Similarly, "Love on the
                    Spectrum," which explores the romantic lives of people on the autism spectrum, expanded the
                    audience's understanding and discussions around neurodiversity, moving beyond stereotypes to a more
                    nuanced representation (thenextweb.com).


                </p>
                <p><span class="image left"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></span>In terms of reshaping global
                    cultural markets, Netflix has been at the forefront, leveraging AI and big data to tailor content to
                    diverse audiences. Its influence is particularly notable in Asia, where its subscriber base exceeded
                    that in the U.S., with over 58 million subscribers by the end of 2018. This growth underscores
                    Netflix’s role in transitioning cultural consumption from traditional media to digital platforms,
                    challenging the long-standing supremacy of television and movie theaters (ebrary.net).



                </p>
                <p><span class="image right"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></span>However, the Netflix effect is
                    not without its drawbacks. Excessive consumption of streaming content has been linked to various
                    health issues. Studies indicate concerns like sleep deprivation, weight gain, and even slight brain
                    damage due to prolonged exposure to screens. Furthermore, there's an observed decline in social and
                    interactive skills among avid users, suggesting a potential negative impact on personal
                    relationships and the ability to form new connections (reviewsphere.org).



                </p>
                <p><span class="image left"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></span>Netflix's role in popularizing
                    niche topics and bringing them into mainstream culture is another aspect of its cultural influence.
                    For example, "Tiger King" not only became a sensation during the lockdown period but also raised
                    awareness about the illegal trade in big cats. Similarly, "The Last Dance" transcended the sports
                    documentary genre, bringing Michael Jordan's story to a new generation and reigniting discussions
                    about his legacy and influence on basketball and beyond (thenextweb.com).



                </p>
                <p><span class="image right"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></span>In summary, Netflix's influence
                    on identity formation and cultural norms is multifaceted and profound. While it offers entertainment
                    and education, shaping global conversations on various topics, it also presents challenges and
                    concerns regarding health and social skills. This complex role underlines the streaming service’s
                    position as a powerful agent in shaping contemporary cultural and social landscapes.
