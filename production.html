					transformation that has significantly reshaped the streaming and entertainment industry. This
					evolution began with a shift from licensing content to investing in original productions. The launch
					of "House of Cards" in 2013 marked the onset of Netflix's journey into original programming, setting
					a new course for the company's content strategy ("Netflixâ€™s Business Strategy Explained" Starting
					Business).

				<p><span class="image right"><img
							src="https://8traordinary.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Picture-D.png" alt="" /></span>Over
					the years, Netflix's content strategy has been characterized by substantial investment and a
					consistent increase in original productions. In 2022, Netflix released 935 original first-run
					titles, representing a 68% increase from the previous year. This rise in content is indicative of
					Netflix's commitment to providing a diverse and expansive library. From 2017 to 2022, Netflix's
					original production hours increased dramatically, with a significant shift in focus towards non-U.S.
					productions, reflecting the company's global expansion ambitions (TBI Tech & Analysis: The where &
					why of Netflix's original content spend - TBI Vision).

				<p><span class="image left"><img src="https://cdn.statcdn.com/Infographic/images/normal/13076.jpeg"
							alt="" /></span>Netflix's original content strategy also involves a significant emphasis on
					international productions. As of March 2022, over 50% of the titles in Netflix's U.S. catalogue were
					Originals or Exclusives. This strategic move has been driven by the rise of studio-led
					direct-to-consumer platforms and the shrinking pool of licensable content. Investing in original
					content allows Netflix to offer exclusive titles internationally without additional licensing costs,
					which is crucial as the company seeks to grow its international subscriber base (Ampere Analysis
					Insights).

				<p><span class="image right"><img src="https://tbivision.com/files/2022/07/Stranger-Things.jpg"
							alt="" /></span>The company's flexibility in content production and promotion has been a key
					advantage over traditional linear networks. Netflix's approach allows for nurturing shows over time
					and providing a platform for more creative storytelling, such as varying episode runtimes and
					flexible season structures. This flexibility, combined with personalized content promotion, has
					enabled Netflix to sustain interest in its series long after their premiere, contributing to the
					platform's popularity and success (Netflix - Overview - Long-Term View).


				</p>
			
				<p><span class="image left"></span>In conclusion, Netflix's
					production strategy, marked by a significant investment in original content, technological
					innovation, and a global focus, has not only disrupted traditional models of content creation but
					also set new standards for streaming platforms. Through its strategic content production, Netflix
					has redefined the entertainment landscape, offering an unparalleled viewing experience and
					continually adapting to the evolving preferences of its global audience.
